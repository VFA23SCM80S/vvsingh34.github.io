                <h2 >About</h2> <br>
                <p id="aboutSection">"Hey! I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois. My academic journey has been complemented by over 2.5 years of valuable professional experience as a Site Reliability Engineer and Full-stack Developer.

                    As a Site Reliability Engineer, I come to you with a strong background in software development, driven by practical experience as a Programmer Analyst and Software Engineer. These roles have significantly contributed to my skills and expertise in the field.

                    <li>During my tenure as a Programmer Analyst at Cognizant Technology Solutions from December 2020 to December 2022, I played a pivotal role in leading global support teams in implementing Change Detection and Baseline Configuration policies for Linux servers. This involved managing local users and groups, providing file system permissions, and ensuring the end-to-end tool deployment and integration process was seamless. I handled Change Requests, Incidents, and Service Requests via ServiceNow, which required a proactive and organized approach to IT service management. </li> <br>
                    
                    <li>Furthermore, I maintained Git version control workflows and actively participated in hot fix Docker image upgrades in Production and Lower-Level Environments. I developed deployment scripts that contributed to consistent application rollouts and managed Kubernetes pods across various environments. My responsibilities included monitoring Kubernetes clusters in Azure and contributing to database activities and version upgrades. These roles were instrumental in ensuring system stability and efficiency, which is crucial in today's IT landscape. </li><br>
                    
                    <li>In addition to my work as a Site Reliability Engineer, my role as a Software Engineer at ProPeersInfo from July 2020 to December 2020 allowed me to proactively collaborate with designers to create sleek interfaces and user-friendly experiences. I managed project concepts and workflow optimization and closely coordinated with senior developers to streamline intricate designs using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Later I also explored and learned NodeJS and React to take my interest to the next level. </li> <br>
                    
                    <li>I have also explored the domain of Data Analytics where I have learned Tableau, MySQL, Python and have done few projects too. This fusion of academic pursuit, a diverse professional background, and technical skills positions me as a versatile and forward-thinking contributor in the field of computer science, with a strong emphasis on web technologies ,Site reliability, and Data Analyst. I am eager to continue expanding my expertise and making a meaningful impact in this dynamic and ever-evolving field." </li></p>
